        <p>American Cocker Spaniel is a breed of sporting dog.</p> 
        <p>
            It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; 
            the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards 
            in the US and the UK. In the United States, the breed is usually called a Cocker 
            Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called an American Cocker Spaniel to 
            distinguish it from its older English cousin. The word cocker is commonly held to 
            stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while spaniel is thought to be 
            derived from the breed's origins in Spain.
        </p> 
        <p>The first spaniel in America came across with the Mayflower in 1620, but it was not until 1878 
            that the first Cocker Spaniel was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC). A national 
            breed club was set up three years later and the dog considered to be the father of the modern 
            breed, Ch. Obo II, was born around this time. By the 1920s the English and American varieties 
            of Cocker had become noticeably different and in 1946 the AKC recognized the English type as 
            a separate breed. It was not until 1970 that The Kennel Club in the UK recognized the American 
            Cocker Spaniel as being separate from the English type. The American Cocker was the most popular 
            breed in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s and again during the 1980s, reigning for 
            a total of 18 years. They have also won the best in show title at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog
             Show on four occasions, the best in show title at Crufts in 2017, and have been linked to
              the President of the United States on several occasions, with owners including Richard Nixon 
              and Harry S. Truman. In 2013, the cocker spaniel ranked 29th the American Kennel Club registration 
              statistics of historical comparisons and notable trends.

                The breed is the smallest of the sporting dogs recognized by the AKC, and its distinctly 
                shaped head makes it immediately recognizable. In addition, there are some marked differences 
                between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, 
                although by being bred to a show standard it is no longer an ideal working dog. Members of 
                the breed suffer from a wide variety of health ailments including problems with their hearts, 
                eyes and ears.
